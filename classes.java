public class classes {
    //In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes)
    // and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
    // Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what a class in Java entails:
    //
    //Key Components of a Class
    //Attributes (Fields): Variables that hold the state of an object.
    //Methods: Functions that define the behavior of an object.
    //Constructors: Special methods used to initialize objects.

    // States
    String name, color;
    int age;
    char sex;

    // Behaviours = Methods
    // Method: is a block of code which only runs when it gets call.
